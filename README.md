# TMS_Efield_Solvers

The codes in "FEM_MEX_C_codes" use matlab MEX interface to speed-up computation and lower memory requirements. They work in linux and windows (have not been tested for ios). See FEM_MEX_C_codes/testcodemex.m for guide on how to run these FEM codes.


If "FEM_MEX_C_codes" do not work use "FEM_slowcodes", which will work in any matlab environment. See FEM_slowcodes/testcode.m for guide on how to use FEM codes

BEM codes will be up by August 1st.
